# Gyroscope-with-Raspberry-pi

This project explores sensor fusion of the various sensors integrated in the MPU9250/MPU9265 module.

The data from the gyroscope is combined with roll and pitch angles from an accelerometer, 
and with heading data from the magnetometer. The resulting data is filtered
to yield an accurate estimation of the sensor's attitude.
